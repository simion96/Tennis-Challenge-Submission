# Tennis Score

This is my submission for the tennis score challenge. I have gone for a class and test approach, which can be found in src/test/GameTest

Running any of the tests will print the score of the game as it executes the commands to see the score at every step. I have included 4 test scenarios that I felt were relevant to the exercise

The string "Game [Winner]" will print out twice in the test, and done purely for visualisation, but the lines responsible forthis (inside getScore()) can be easily commented out and the tests should still work.
